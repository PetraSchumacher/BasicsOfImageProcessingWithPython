    "In general, it is of course desirable to work with images with as little noise as possible. However, for learnning purposes, it can be helpful to manipulate images in a way to make them appear as if the sensor had some defects and the images were very noisy. This way, we can test e.g. filtering algorithms and immmediately investigate their effect on the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate noise, we can e.g. assign random values to random pixels. Another posibility could be e.g. changing the intensity of selected pixels by a random offset or scaling actor. A lot of reserach has been done on noise models, but for this course, let's keep it simple and simply replace pixels with random values. Let's assume we would like to manipulate the greyscale image `myImg_greyscale` (It works analogously with color images, however we then have to first split the image in the three color channels and then individually manipulate each of the channels). First, we choose the coordinates of 100 random pixels (you can of course also change this factor to make the image more or less noisy and see how this affects the blurring). To select random numbers, we first have to import the `random ` library and add the following statement to the imports:"
