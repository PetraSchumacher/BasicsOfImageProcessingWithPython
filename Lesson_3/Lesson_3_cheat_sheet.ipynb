    "Images are typically captured and dsaved in the RGB-color space. Also, if you read in images with `cv2.imread`, this model is applied (however, the channel order is reersed from RGB to BGR). Let us assume you have read in a color image `myImg` and would like to convert it to another colorspace. The ch2 library offers several possibilities for color transformation with the `cv2.cvtColor` method. The first argument corresponds to the image you would like to transform, the second the type of transformation you would like to apply.\n",

    "First let's see how to convert an RGB (BGR)-image to the HSV-color space. Here, you use the `cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV` transformation. The result will be a 3-dimensional array, with the first two dimensions corresponding to the spatial axes and the third dimension corresponding to the hue, saturation and value channel. You can then use these three channels and manipulate them individually.\n",

    "You can now manipulate the three parameters individually, for example, double the saturation. Be aware of the data type you are using: if you e.g. use an 8-bit image and your pixel has a saturation of 180, you will see a value overflow and doubling the saturation will result in a saturation of 105 if the input is simply multiplied by 2. To prevent this, first convert the saturation to a larger data type, e.g. `np.uint16` and perform the multiplication on that result . Then, clip the result to the allowed value range of your input format, e.g. to 0 to 255 for 8-bit images by using `np.clip()` . Finally, convert the result back to the initial data type with `.astype()`. So, doubling the saturation could e.g. look like this:"
